            <p>Welcome to HADESTOWN, where a song can change your fate. This acclaimed new musical by celebrated singer-songwriter Anaïs Mitchell and innovative director Rachel Chavkin (Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812) is a love story for today... and always.</p>
            <p>HADESTOWN  intertwines two mythic tales — that of young dreamers Orpheus and Eurydice, and that of King Hades and his wife Persephone — as it invites you on a hell-raising journey to the underworld and back. Mitchell’s beguiling melodies and Chavkin’s poetic imagination pit industry against nature, doubt against faith, and fear against love. Performed by a vibrant ensemble of actors, dancers and singers, HADESTOWN  is a haunting and hopeful theatrical experience that grabs you and never lets go.</p>

                        <h2>JESSIE SHELTON</h2>
                        <h4>SWING</h4>
                        <p>Jessie Shelton is an actor and multidisciplinary performer based in New York City. She is fresh off the road as Dawn in the first national tour of Waitress and could not think of a better way to make her Broadway debut than with Hadestown, a piece wildly dear to her heart! Some recent favorite roles include Lady Dare Bellingdon in Conflict (Mint Theatre) and Judith in 36 Questions, a musical podcast in which she starred opposite Jonathan Groff. Huge thanks to the team at Wolf Talent and the entire company of Hadestown(s) past and present. Love to M&P, M&K, H&N and my Matt most of all.</p>
